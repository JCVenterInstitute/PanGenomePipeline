=head1 NAME

grid_tasks.pm - not-so-fancy module for launching/monitoring grid jobs with a strong slant towards the JCVI grid configuration.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    uae grid_tasks;

    my @job_ids;
    push @job_ids, launch_grid_job( $project_code, $working_dir, $shell_script, $stdoutdir, $stderrdir, $queue, $job_array_max );
    # ... repeat for more jobs if you want.

    wait_for_grid_jobs( \@job_ids );
    # Or if you launched as an array-job:
    wait_for_grid_jobs_arrays( \@job_ids );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Quick start guide:

 1. Create a shell script for the job.
 2. Call launch_grid_job, store the returned job_id in an array
 3. Repeat if more jobs are to be launched.
 4. If invoked with $job_array_max defined, call wait_for_grid_jobs_arrays,
    otherwise, call wait_for_grid_jobs

 Control is returned upon grid job completion.

There are numerous use cases unsupported by this module at the moment.  Notably:

 When using jobs that wait for other jobs.
 Using task ids that increment with an integer other than 1.
 When resubmitting job_arrays that have errored-tasks reset by using qmod -cj
 
This module will likely grow and change to support fancier submissions.
